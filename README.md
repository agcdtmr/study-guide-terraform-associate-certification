## Active Recalling

Active recalling is a learning technique that involves actively retrieving information from memory rather than passively re-reading or reviewing material. It's the process of intentionally trying to remember something without looking at the source material, which strengthens memory and improves long-term retention.

Anki and Quizlet are both tools that utilize active recall for learning:

1. **Anki:** Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program. It uses an algorithm to determine when you should review a particular flashcard based on how well you remember it. It's highly customizable and often used for language learning, medical studies, and various academic subjects.

2. **Quizlet:** Quizlet is an online platform where users can create and study flashcards. It offers various study modes like flashcards, tests, games, and more. Users can create their own sets or access pre-made sets on a wide range of topics.

For passing the Terraform Associate Certification (003), using active recall methods like Anki or Quizlet can be beneficial because:

1. **Memory Retention:** Active recalling helps in retaining information for a longer duration. The Terraform certification involves understanding various Terraform concepts, commands, configurations, and best practices. Using active recall tools can help reinforce this knowledge.

2. **Efficient Study:** With Anki or Quizlet, you can focus on the areas you find challenging. These tools adapt to your performance, emphasizing weaker areas and reducing time spent on concepts you've mastered.

3. **Consistent Revision:** The spaced repetition feature in Anki ensures you revisit information at optimal intervals, reinforcing your memory and preventing forgetting.

4. **Practical Application:** Terraform certification requires not just memorization but practical application of knowledge. Active recall methods can help in recalling commands, syntax, and concepts which are crucial during the exam and while working with Terraform.

In essence, using active recall tools like Anki or Quizlet can be an efficient and effective method to reinforce Terraform concepts, commands, and configurations necessary for passing the certification exam.
